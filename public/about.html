<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Akash Kushwaha and I am from Jhansi. Currently I am persuing B.Tech. in ECE branch from
   Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College, Ghaziabad.</p>

<p>I have six members in my family. My father is a UP Police Head Constable and is currently posted in Police Training School,
   Meerut, Uttar Pradesh.My mother is a housewife and lives in Jhansi. My eldest sister is a software developer in 
   Iredeto Technologies, Noida.Then my second sister is currently persuing B.T.C. from Jhansi. My elder brother is a game developer
  in RenderARVR, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.</p>

<p>Engineering was not my first choice, infact it was not my choice. My dream was to join Defence Services and I even 
  had put efforts for it. I cleared NDA written examination twice but got SSB Conference out in first time and Screen out in second.
Then I opted for Engineering and now it is my one and only choice.</p>
